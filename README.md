Create a prompt to ask a user if they want to quit. If they don't enter yes or y, then ask if they are sure. Continually ask if they are really sure and add additonals reallys each time they don't enter yes or y.

Example

Do you want to quit? n

Are you sure? n

Are you really sure? n

Are you really really sure? y

Great!
